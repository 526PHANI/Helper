            "question": "What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?",
            "answer": "A compiler translates the whole program at once before running it (Example: C, C++). An interpreter translates and runs the program line by line (Example: Python, JavaScript)."

            "question": "What is the difference between call by value and call by reference?",

            "question": "What is the difference between a structure and a union?",
            "answer": "A structure stores all its members separately, while a union shares the same memory for all members, so only one can be used at a time."

            "question": "What is the difference between malloc() and calloc()?",
